# A and B are 2 arrays of numbers (they can be unequal length, min len=1). 

# Their sums are unequal.

# However just by one swap in these 2 arrays their sum will become equal.

# You have to return the 2 elements which when swapped, make the sum of A and B equal. 

# Can you solve this in 0(n) time ?
