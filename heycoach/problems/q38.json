    "description": "Scarlet is a librarian of a famous library. She manage the books of this library. One day she was analysing one of the book shelf and she notices that some of the books in that book shelf haven't made any profit for past few months so she decided to move this non-profitable books to the end of the shelf while keeping the relative order of the remaining books same. A shelf contain **N** number of books from left to right. So you have given an array profits where ==profits[i]== is indicating the  profit generated by the ith book. You have to move the **non-profitable** books to the end of shelf i.e. books with profits[i]=0. Can you help Scarlet in this task? \n\n**Note**:you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.\n\n\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nprofits = [0,2,3,0,0,5,6]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[2,3,5,6,0,0,0]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n\nall the 3 non-profitable books have been move to the end of the shelf. \n**Note**: [2,5,3,6,0,0,0] this arrangement is wrong because even though the non-profitable books are at the end but the relative order of 3 and 5 is not mantained.\n\n\n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\n profits = [3,0,0]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[3,0,0]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n\nnon-profitable books are already at the end of shelf.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n* 1 <= N= 10000\n* 0 <= profits[i] <= 1000000 \n\n\n\n\n",
