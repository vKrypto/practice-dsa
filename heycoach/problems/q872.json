    "description": "Bizon the Champion, a member of the \"Bizons\" team, is faced with a challenge during a competition. The challenge is to transform one word, `s`, into another word, `t`, using advanced data structures known as suffix structures. The team has expertise in different suffix structures which include the suffix automaton and the suffix array:\n\n- **Suffix Automaton:** `Allows the removal of any single character from a string each time it is applied.`\n- **Suffix Array:** `Allows any two characters of the string to be swapped each time it is applied.`\n\n`The task is to determine if it's possible to transform `s` into `t` using these structures, and if so, identify which structures are needed.`\n\n**Input Format:**\n- `The first line contains the word` `s`, `a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.`\n- `The second line contains the word` `t`, `a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.`\n\n**Output Format:**\n- `Print \"need tree\" if it's impossible to transform `s` into `t` even using both suffix array and suffix automaton.`\n- `Print \"automaton\" if only the suffix automaton is needed.`\n- `Print \"array\" if only the suffix array is required.`\n- `Print \"both\" if both data structures are required.`\n\n**Constraints:**\n- `Both words `s` and `t` are distinct and consist of at most 100 lowercase English letters.`\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n#### `Input:`\n```\nautomaton\ntomat\n```\n#### `Output:`\n```\nautomaton\n```\n**Explanation:**\n- The word \"tomat\" can be formed by removing some characters from \"automaton\" using the suffix automaton.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n#### `Input:`<br/>\n```\narray  \narray   \n```\n#### `Output:` \narray\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `By swapping the third and fifth characters of \"array\", you can obtain \"arary\". This can be achieved using the suffix array.`\n\n**Detailed Scenarios:**\n1. **Automaton Only:** `If` `t` `can be formed by removing characters from` `s` `without rearranging the order of the remaining characters.`\n2. **Array Only:** `If` `t` `can be formed by rearranging the characters in `s` (i.e., `s` and `t` are anagrams).`\n3. **Both Needed:** `If` `t` `requires characters to be removed and the remaining characters to be rearranged.`\n4. **Need Tree:** `If it's impossible to form` `t` `from` `s` `even with any combination of operations allowed by the suffix automaton and array. `",
