    "description": "You are given an array `a` of `n` integers denoting the blocks of wall, where each integer is either `0`, `1`, or `2`. **Initially**, each block of the wall is painted blue.\n\nYour **goal** is to paint each block of the wall red. In order to do so, you can perform operations of two types: **1)** pay one coin to choose a blue block and paint it red, **2)** choose a red block which is not equal to 0 and a blue block adjacent to it, decrease the chosen red block by 1, and paint the chosen blue element red.\n\nWhat is the **minimum** number of coins you have to spend to achieve your **goal**?\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nInput : n = 3, a = [0,2,0]\n\nOutput : 1\n\nExplanation\n\nyou can paint all elements red with having to spend only one coin as follows:\n\npaint the 2nd block red by spending one coin;\ndecrease the 2nd block by 1 and paint the 1st block red;\ndecrease the 2nd block by 1 and paint the 3rd block red.\n```\n\n**Input Format**\n```\nThe first line contains one integer n \nThe second line contains n integers denoting the array a.\n```\n**Output Format**\n```\nAn integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins you have to spend in order to paint all blocks red.\n````\n\n**Contraints**\n\n`1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`\n\n`0 <= a[i] <= 2`\n",
