    "description": "You stand amidst a mystical land split into two opposing towers, each brimming with magical energy. Each tower's power is represented by the values in the nums array. Your goal? Restore balance to this land by strategically removing magical artifacts (subsequences of n elements) from the combined power source (the nums array).\n\nYou're given an array nums containing the magical energies of both towers (3*n elements, all positive integers between 1 and 10^5).\nYou must remove exactly n elements from nums (a subsequence), effectively weakening one tower while leaving the other untouched.\nThe remaining 2 * n elements in nums will be divided into two equal parts: the first n elements representing the remaining power of the first tower, and the next n elements representing the second tower's power.\nYour mission is to minimize the absolute difference between the final powers of the two towers after your strategic removal. Remember, a perfect balance ensures peace and stability!\n\n### Input/Output Format:\n\n#### Input: \nAn array nums containing the combined magical energies of both towers separated by spaces or commas.\n\n#### Output: \nA single integer representing the minimum absolute difference in power between the two towers after your strategic removal of n elements.\n\n### Examples:\n\n#### Input: \n3 1 2 (The magical currents within the towers)\n\n#### Output: -\n1 (Removing any element will result in a difference of 1. We can minimize this by choosing the element that makes the difference negative: removing the first element (3) leads to a difference of 1 - 2 = -1.)\n\n#### Input: \n7 9 5 8 1 3 (Another land on the brink of imbalance)\n\n#### Output: \n1 (Similar to the first example, strategically removing the second element (9) and the fifth element (1) minimizes the power difference to (7 + 5) - (8 + 3) = 12 - 11 = 1.)\n\n### Constraints:\n\nnums.length == 3 * n (Total number of magical artifacts in both towers)<br>\n1 <= n <= 10^5 (The number of artifacts you must remove)<br>\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5 (Individual artifact's magical energy)",
