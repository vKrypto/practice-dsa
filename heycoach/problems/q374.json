    "description": "**Problem Description:**\n\nHarry has been given a string, denoted as 's,' and an integer, denoted as 'd.' He is tasked with finding a non-empty substring from the given string 's' that contains at most 'd' distinct characters. The goal is to find such a substring that maximizes its score, where the score of a substring is defined as the sum of hash values of all characters in that substring.\n\nAdditionally, each character in the string 's' is assigned a hash value, which is represented as follows:\n- 'a' \u2192 1\n- 'b' \u2192 2\n- ...\n- 'z' \u2192 26\n\nAll character in string are lower case alphabate only<br>\nYou need to assist Harry in solving this problem by finding the maximum score of a non-empty substring with at most 'd' distinct characters.\n\n**Input:**\n- A string 's' (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 10^5), where |s| represents the length of the string.\n- An integer 'd' (1 \u2264 d \u2264 26), representing the maximum number of distinct characters allowed in the substring.\n\n**Output:**\n- An integer representing the maximum score of a non-empty substring with at most 'd' distinct characters.\n\n**Sample Input 1:**\n```\ns = \"abcde\"\nd = 2\n```\n\n**Sample Output 1:**\n```\n9\n```\n\n**Explanation 1:**\n- Harry can select the substring \"bc\" with 'd' distinct characters ('b' and 'c'), and the score of this substring is the sum of the hash values of its characters: score(\"bc\") = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- Alternatively, he can select the substring \"de\" with 'd' distinct characters ('d' and 'e'), and the score of this substring is the sum of the hash values of its characters: score(\"de\") = 4+ 5 = 9.\n- In this case, the maximum score is 9, achieved by selecting the substring \"de.\"\n\n**Sample Input 2:**\n```\ns = \"xyzzy\"\nd = 3\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2:**\n```\n126\n```\n\n**Explanation 2:**\n- Harry can select the substring \"xyzzy\" with 'd' distinct characters ('x,' 'y,' and 'z'), and the score of this substring is the sum of the hash values of its characters: score(\"xyzzy\") = 24 + 25 + 26 + 26 + 25 = 126.\n- In this case, the maximum score is 126, achieved by selecting the entire string \"xyzzy.\"",
