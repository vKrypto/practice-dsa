    "description": "In the friendly village of Sortville, there lived a kind wizard named Willy. Willy was known for his love of arranging things neatly. One day, while exploring the forest, he found a box filled with jumbled-up numbers written on colourful pebbles. \nWilly wanted to put them in order because he thought it would be fun.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n### Task:<br/>\n```\nNow, it's your job to help Willy arrange these colourful pebbles in the correct order. Write a program named mergeSort to sort the numbers on the pebbles using this method.\n\nExpected Time Complexity is O(n*log(n))\n```\n#### `Input:`\n\n```\nAn integer n (1 to 100,000), tells you how many pebbles there are.\n\nA list of n numbers, written on the pebbles. Each number is between 1 and 100,000.\n\n```\n\n#### `Output:`\n```A list of n numbers, the pebbles sorted from the smallest to the biggest.```\n\n#### `Input:`\n```\n4\n\n10 5 3 7\n\n```\n\n#### `Output:`  \n```\n3 5 7 10\n```",
