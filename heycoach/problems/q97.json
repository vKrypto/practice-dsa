    "description": "Shinobi's training starts tomorrow, and he has decided to make plans for it now.\nThe training consists of  N  days. For each  i  (0 <= i < N), Shinobi will choose `one` of the following activities and do it on the  `i-th day`:\n\n-   A: Swim in the sea. Gain  points[i][0]\u200b  points.\n-   B: Fighting practice in the mountains. Gain  points[i][1]  points.\n-   C: Do Running. Gain  points[i][2]  points.\n\nAs Shinobi wants to improve all his skills, he **cannot** do the same activities for **two or more consecutive days**.\n\nFind the `maximum` possible total points that Shinobi gains by training each of the N days.\n\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP \nN = 3\n10 40 70\n20 50 80\n30 60 90\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n210\n``` \n#### Explanation:\nIf Shinobi does activities in the order `points[i][2]`, `points[i][1]`, `points[i][2]`, he will gain 70 + 50 + 90 =210 points.\n\n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nN = 1\n100 10 1\n```\n### Output \n```CPP \n100\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n\nShinobi can earn 100 points by doing the first activity on the first day.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n* 1 <= N <= 10000\n* 1 <= points[i][j] <= 10000\n",
