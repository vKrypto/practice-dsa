    "description": "There are given n wires of different lengths, we need to connect these wires into one wire. The **cost to connect two wires is equal to sum of their lengths**. The task is to connect the wires with **minimum cost**. Given n size array wires[] which contains the lengths of the wires.\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nn = 4\nwires = [4, 3, 2, 6]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n29\n``` \n#### Explanation:\nWe can connect the wires in following ways:\n*  First connect wires of lengths 2 and 3. Which makes the array {4, 5, 6}. Cost of this operation 2+3 = 5. \n*  Now connect wires of lengths 4 and 5. Which makes the array {9, 6}. Cost of this operation 4+5 = 9.\n*  Finally connect the two wires and all wires have connected. Cost of this operation 9+6 =15\n* Total cost for connecting all wires is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost for connecting wires. \n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nn = 5\nwires = [4, 2, 7, 6, 9]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n62 \n``` \n#### Explanation:\n* First, connect wires 4 and 2, which makes the array {6,7,6,9}. Cost of this operation 4+2 = 6.\n* Next, add wires 6 and 6, which results in {12,7,9}. Cost of this operation 6+6 = 12.\n* Then, add 7 and 9, which makes the array {12,16}. Cost of this operation 7+9 = 16.\n* And finally, add these two which gives {28}.Hence, the total cost is 6 + 12 + 16 + 28 = 62.\n### Constraints:\n\n* 1 <= n <= 10000\n* 1 <= wires[i] <= 100000\n",
