    "description": "\nYou are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete `at most two transactions`.\n\n- Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n  A `subarray` is a contiguous part of an array.\n\n### Example 1\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\nprices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n6\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n```\nBuy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\nThen buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.\n```\n\n### Example 2\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\nprices = [1,2,3,4,5]\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n```\nBuy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\nNote that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n```\n### Input Format\n```\nGiven an array prices of n elements \n```\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput the maximum profit you can achieve By completing at most two transactions.\n```\n\n\n### Constraints:\n\n`- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`\n\n`- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^9`\n",
