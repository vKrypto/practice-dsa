    "description": "You are given an integer array  `deck`. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the  `ith`  card is  `deck[i]`.\n\nYou can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.\n\nYou will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:\n\n1.  Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.\n2.  If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.\n3.  If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.\n\nReturn  _an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order_.\n\n**Note**  that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.\n\n### Sample Input 1\n\n```\ndeck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]\n```\n### Sample Output 1\n\n```\n[2,13,3,11,5,17,7]\n```\n### Explanation\n\n```\nWe get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.\nAfter reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.\nWe reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].\nWe reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].\nWe reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].\nWe reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].\nWe reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].\nWe reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].\nWe reveal 17.\nSince all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.\n \n```\n### Sample Input 2\n\n```\ndeck = [1,1000]\n```\n### Sample Output 2\n\n```\n [1,1000]\n```\n### Input Format\n```\nFirst Line Contains an integer array deck\n```\n### Output Format\n```\nAn Integer Array result representing ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.\n```\n### Constraints\n\n-   `1 <= deck.length <= 10000`\n-   `1 <= deck[i] <= 10000`\n-   All the values of  `deck` are  **unique**.\n\n\n",
