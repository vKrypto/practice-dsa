    "description": "Description:\nAjay and Vijay are playing an intense game, they are provided an array a with n positive integers which has the following rules:\n1.  \tIf a1=0, the game ends and the person whose turn it is loses. (a1 is the element at 1th position)\n2.  \tIn a move a player can choose i such that 2<=i<=n. The player decreases the value of a1 by 1 and swaps ai (ith position) by a1(1th position).\n3.  \tAjay always plays first.\n\nPrint the winner of the game if they both play the game logically.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say that n=2 and a = [1,1] now Ajay goes first and he chooses i=2 (only choice), now a1=1 gets reduced to 0 and after that it is swapped with a2 = 1 so the array we end up with is a = [1,0]\n\nNow it is the turn of Vijay, so he then chooses i=2 (only choice) , now a1=1 gets reduced to zero and after that it is swapped with a2=0 and the array is a= [0,0].\nIt\u2019s Ajay\u2019s turn now and a1 = 0, thus the winner of the game is \u201cVijay\u201d.\n \nSample Input:\n\nN = 2, a = [2, 1]\n\nSample Output:\n\nAjay\n \nConstraints:\n\n2<=n<=10^4\n\n1<=ai<=10^8\n",
