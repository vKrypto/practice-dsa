    "description": "Given two arrays, find their intersection and union and print the result in the solution function. A union between two arrays is defined as all the elements that occur in any one of the arrays, for example a = 1,2,2,3,4 and b = 1,1,3,5,6,6 the union of these arrays is U = 1,2,3,4,5,6. Intersection between two arrays is defined as all the elements that are present in both the arrays, considering the same example the intersection of those array is I = 1,3. \n\n**NOTE:**  ***You have to print the union array first and then in the next line print the intersection array. Also while printing make sure these things are followed.***\n```\n1. There is a space after each element except the last one.\n2.  First Union array should be printed then in the next line intersection array.\n```\n#### `Sample Input:`\n\n3 4  \n1 5 9  \n1 4 6 8\n\n#### Sample Output:\n\n1 4 5 6 8\n\n1\n\n#### `Constraints:`\n\n- `1<=number of elements of array<=10^5`\n\n- `1<=Value of each element<=10^5`",
