    "description": "You have been given a land in the form an array of size n. On each index, there is a king who wants to determine\nits property. Land at each index has some value. Every king considers every land to its left and right his property until he does not see land of value bigger than his. Note that the value of individual land does not change based on the consideration of kings. You have to print the value of land that each king considers to be his.\n\n**Sample Input:**\n\n5<br>\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n**Sample Output:**  \n1 3 6 10 15 \n\n**Explanation:**\nThe king on the 0th index sees no land in value less or equal than his and thus considers his total value as 1 whereas the king on the 4th index sees every land below his value and thus gets a total value of 15. \n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n1 <= n <= 10^4\n\n1 <= lands[i] <= 10^4",
