    "description": "Alice like to eat candies.There are only 3 types of candies available which Alice can choose to eat that is ==red==, ==green== and ==blue==. Alice always eats red candies first followed by green  and then blue candies. So you have given an array candies consisting of n integers which contains only ==0s==,==1s== and ==2s== where 0 is representing red candy,1 is representing green candy and 2 representing blue candy. But the order of candies are not sorted according to Alice preference so Alice asks for your help to arrange the candies in such a way that all red candies comes first followed by green and blue candies. Can you help Alice to achieve this?\n\n\n\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\ncandies = [0,1,2,0,1,1,0,2]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n\n3 red candies comes in the starting followed by 3 green candies and then 2 blue candies so the candies are segregated according to Alice preference.\n\n\n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\n candies = [1,2,2,1,1]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[1,1,1,2,2]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n\nAs there are no red candies so green candies will come first then the blue candies.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n* 1 <= n= 10000\n* 0 <= candies[i] <= 2\n\n\n",
