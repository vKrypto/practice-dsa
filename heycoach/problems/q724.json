    "description": "Rishav is a medical student and he needs to complete the assignment to find all the repeating DNA sequence of length 10. He is a non technical student so he has to doo it manually. As being his good friend write a code for him.\n\nThe DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.\n\nFor example, \"ACGAATTCCG\" is a DNA sequence. When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\n\nGiven a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may Print the answer in sorted order.\n\n#### Example:\n##### Sample Input\n`AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT  `\n##### Sample Output\n\n```\nAAAAACCCCC\nCCCCCAAAAA\n```\n\n\n#### Input Format:\n`single string input`\n#### Output Format:\n`print all the output strings in separate lines (1 string in 1 line)`\n#### Constraints:\n\n```\n1 <= s.length <= 10^5 \ns[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.\n```",
