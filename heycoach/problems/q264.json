    "description": "\nIn English, we have a concept called `root`, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the `root` \"an\" is followed by the `successor` word \"other\", we can form a new word \"another\".\n\nGiven a dictionary consisting of many `roots` and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the `successors` in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.\n\nReturn the sentence after the replacement.\n\n### Example 1\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\ndictionary = [\"cat\",\"bat\",\"rat\"], sentence = \"the cattle was rattled by the battery\"\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n\"the cat was rat by the bat\"\n```\n\n### Example 2\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\ndictionary = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"], sentence = \"aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs\"\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n\"a a b c\"\n```\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000\n- 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100\n- dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.\n- 1 <= sentence.length <= 106\n- sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.\n- The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\n- The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\n- Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.\n- sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n",
