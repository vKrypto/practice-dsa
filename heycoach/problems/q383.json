    "description": "In the peaceful village of Melodyville, musicians are practising for an upcoming concert. Each musician is assigned a musical note represented by an integer. </br>\nThe harmony of the concert is disrupted when two musicians with adjacent notes have a \"local discordance.\" A local discordance occurs when the absolute difference between \nthe notes of two adjacent musicians are greater than or equal to the specified threshold. </br>\nYour task is to find and print all pairs of musicians that have local discordances. Write a function findLocalDiscordances that takes an array of musical notes (integers) and a\n threshold as input and prints all pairs of musicians that have local discordances.\n\n\n**`Sample Test Cases:`**\n\n**`Input:`**\n\n```\n5\n\n3 6 10 14 18\n\n4\n```\n\n**`Output: `**\n\n```\nThe index of the musicians that have local discordance.\nIn the above test case:\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n```\n\n**`Constraints:-`**\n\n- `The number of musicians (n) is between 2 and 1000.`\n- `Each musical note is an integer between 1 and 10^9.`\n- `The threshold (threshold) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.`",
