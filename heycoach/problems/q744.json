    "description": "Dholu and Bholu's father has just passed away, it is a sad day. They left a will based on which the land is to be divided among the two brother. The farm is divided into sugarcane farm and wheat farm. According to the will, Dholu can take any square sugarcane land from the original farm. For example let's say the given farm is this.\n\nS S S\n\nW W W\n\nW W W\n\nThen the maximum square sugarcane land that Dholu can get is 1 sq unit. Return the maximum sq unit land that Dholu can get.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line contains two space separated integers 'n' and 'm' which represents an n x m size farm.\n\nThe next n lines contains a string of size m consisting of \"S\" and \"W\" where S represents a Sugarcane Land and W represents a Wheat Land.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nReturn a single integer denoting the maximum sq unit sugarcane land that Dholu can get.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1<=n,m<=20\n\n",
