    "description": "You have reached the finals of a problem solving tournament, in the last challenge you are given two  arrays a and b both of size n and you can choose any element of array b and swap it with some other element of array b but only once. You are allowed to swap that element with itself effectively making the array b unchanged.\n\nYour task is to minimize the sum of |ai-bi| for all i from 0 to n-1.\n```\nSample Input - 1:\n\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output - 1\n\n4\n```\n\nExplanation: In order to minimize the sum we can swap the first and fifth element which make the array b as [5 2 3 4 1]\nand sum = (5-5) + (4 -2) + (3-3) + (2-4) + (1-1) = 4 which is the minimum possible.\n\n```\nSample Input - 2\n\n5\n4 2 8 1 6\n9 7 3 2 4\n\nSample Output - 2\n\n10\n```\nExplanation: You can swap the element at index 0 (9) with the one at index 2 (3). The total sum comes out to be 10 which is the minimum possible.\n\n```\nConstraints:\n\n1<=n<=10^5\n1<=a[i],b[i]<=10^8\n```",
