    "description": "There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array of tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].\n\nEach person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.\n\n`Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.`\n\n#### `Constraints:`\n\n`n == tickets.length`<br>\n`1 <= n <= 100`<br>\n`1 <= tickets[i] <= 100`<br>\n`0 <= k < n`\n\n#### `Example`1:\n\n**`Input:`** `tickets` `=` `[2,3,2],` `k = 2`<br>\n**`Output:`** `6`<br>\n**` Explanation:`** \n- `In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].`\n- `In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].`\n- `The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.`\n\n\n",
