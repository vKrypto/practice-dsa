    "description": "Slavic and his friends are planning to attend a party, traveling through a network of cities. Each city offers a bike for sale, characterized by its \"slowness factor,\" and Slavic wants to minimize his travel time since he dislikes biking.\n\nThe cities are laid out as nodes in an undirected graph, where edges represent roads between cities with specified lengths. Once Slavic purchases a bike in any city, he can use it to travel to neighboring cities; the travel time on a road using a bike is the product of the road's length and the bike's slowness factor.\n\nSlavic's objective is to reach the party (located in the last city of the list) from his starting point (the first city) in the shortest possible time. He can buy any number of bikes, as money is no constraint, but must use a bike for traveling.\n\n**Input:**\n\n- The input begins with an integer `t` (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100), the number of test cases.\n- For each test case:\n  - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000; n-1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000), representing the number of cities and roads, respectively.\n  - Each of the next `m` lines describes a road with three integers `u_i`, `v_i`, `w_i` (1 \u2264 u_i, v_i \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^5), indicating a road of length `w_i` between cities `u_i` and `v_i`.\n  - The last line of the test case contains `n` integers `s_1, ..., s_n` (1 \u2264 s_i \u2264 1000), denoting the slowness factor of the bike available in each city.\n\n**Output:**\n\n- For each test case, output the shortest amount of time required for Slavic to travel from city 1 to city n using the bikes available.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- It is possible to travel from city 1 to any other city.\n- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 1000.\n- The sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 1000.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInput:\n```\n3\n5 5\n1 2 2\n3 2 1\n2 4 5\n2 5 7\n4 5 1\n5 2 1 3 3\n5 10\n1 2 5\n1 3 5\n1 4 4\n1 5 8\n2 3 6\n2 4 3\n2 5 2\n3 4 1\n3 5 8\n4 5 2\n7 2 8 4 1\n7 10\n3 2 8\n2 1 4\n2 5 7\n2 6 4\n7 1 2\n4 3 5\n6 4 2\n6 7 1\n6 7 4\n4 5 9\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n19\n36\n14\n```\n\n**Task:**\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal strategy for Slavic to purchase and use bikes as he travels from the first city to the party, ensuring that his total travel time is minimized.\n",
