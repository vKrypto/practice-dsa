    "description": "Given equations in the form of a/b = k, where a and b are variables and k is a constant, evaluate queries of the form c/d and determine if they can be evaluated using the given equations.\nReturn the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.\n\nNote: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.\n\nNote: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= Number of equations <= 20\nEach equation is of the form \"a/b = k\" where 1 <= |a|, |b| <= 5\n1 <= Number of queries <= 100\nEach query is of the form \"c/d\" where 1 <= |c|, |d| <= 5",
