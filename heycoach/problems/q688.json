    "description": "Alice and his sister are playing with two arrays `a` which consist `n` elements and `b` consisting of `m` elements. The array `a` is given to Alice and `b` to his sister.\n As Alice is really naughty he wants the **minimum** value of his array `a` should be **at least** as much as the **maximum** value of his sister's array `b`. \nNow You have to help Alice in achieving his condition. You can perform multiple operations on the array. In single operation, you are allowed to **increase** or **decrease** any element of any of the arrays by 1.\n `Note that you are allowed to apply the operation on any index of the array multiple times`.\nYou need to find the **minimum** number of operations required to satisfy Alice's condition.\n\n\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nn = 2, m = 2  \na = [2,3]  \nb = [3,5]\n```\n\n\n### Output \n```CPP\n3\n```\n### Explanation\nIn example 1, you can increase a1 by 1 and decrease b2 by 1 and then again decrease b2 by 1. Now array a will be [3,3] and array b will also be [3, 3]. Here minimum element of a is at least as large as maximum element of b. So minimum number of operations needed to satisfy Alice's condition are 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:**\n```CPP\nn = 3,m = 2  \na = [4,5,6]  \nb = [1,2]\n```\n**Output:** \n```CPP\n0\n```\n### Explanation\nyou don't need to do any operation, Alice's condition is already satisfied.\n\n\n### Constraints:\n* `1 <= n,m <= 10000`\n\n* `1 <= a[i],b[i]<= 10000`\n",
