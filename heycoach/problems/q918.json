    "description": "You have an array called `cookies`, where cookies[i] represents the number of cookies in the ith bag. Additionally, you're given an integer \"k,\" which indicates the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to. Each bag's cookies must be given entirely to one child; they can't be divided.\n\nThe *unfairness* of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.\n\nReturn the minimum *unfairness* of all distributions.\n\n**Example 1:**</br>\nInput: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3</br>\nOutput: 7</br>\nExplanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]\n- The 1st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.\n- The 2nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.\n- The 3rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.\nThe unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.\nIt can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.\n\n**Example2:**</br>\nInput: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2</br>\nOutput: 31</br>\nExplanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]\n- The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.\n- The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.\nThe unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.\nIt can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- 2 <= cookies.length <= 8\n- 1 <= cookies[i] <= 105\n- 2 <= k <= cookies.length\n\n",
