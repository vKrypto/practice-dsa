    "description": "\n\nGiven an array of strings, `words`, and an integer, `k`, your task is to return the `k` most frequent strings. The output should be sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest, and words with the same frequency should be sorted in lexicographical order.\n\n**`Input Format:`**\n- `The first line contains two integers, `n` and `k`, representing the size of the array and the number of most frequent words to return, respectively.`\n- `The second line contains `n` space-separated words.`\n\n**`Output Format:`**\n- `Print `k` single space-separated words that are the most frequent in the given array, sorted by their frequency and then lexicographically.`\n\n\n\n**`Sample Input 1:`**\n```\n6 2\ni love hritik i love coding\n```\n\n**`Sample Output 1:`**\n```\ni love\n```\n\n**`Explanation 1:`**\n- `The words \"i\" and \"love\" both appear twice, making them the most frequent words in the given array. They are returned in lexicographical order as they have the same frequency.`\n\n**`Sample Input 2:`**\n```\n4 2\napple banana apple fruit\n```\n\n**`Sample Output 2:`**\n```\napple banana\n```\n\n**`Explanation 2:`**\n\n`The word \"apple\" appears twice, making it the most frequent word. The words \"banana\" and \"fruit\" both appear once, but \"banana\" comes before \"fruit\" in lexicographical order. Since `k = 2`, only \"apple\" and \"banana\" are returned.`\n\n **`Constraints:`**\n- `1 <= words.length <= 500`\n- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`\n- `words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.`\n- `k  is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]`",
