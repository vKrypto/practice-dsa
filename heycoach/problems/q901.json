    "description": "You are walking in some dangerous woods. You encounter three bears and you must defeat them. The hell bear 1 has a health a, the second bear has health b and the last one has health c. Thankfully you have a gun with you which deals 1 damage to any bears you fire the gun at. Apart from the the gun also has some special feature that is at every 7th shot(i.e. shot number 7, 14, 21,..7*n) the gun makes a split shot and deals 1 damage to all the three bears.  \n\nYou want to escape the forest but you wish to do it with style, that is you want your last shot such that it kills all the three Bears at once. A Bear dies when its health reaches zero, so basically the last shot should make the health of all three bear's health zero at once.\n\nIf this can be done then return true else return false.\n\n```\nSample Input - 1:\n\n3 2 4\n\nSample Output -1:\nTrue\n\n\nExplanation: Let us see all the shots:\n\nShot 1 : Target the first bear- 2 2 4\nShot 2 : Target the first bear again - 1 2 4\nShot 3 : Target the second bear: 1 1 4\n\nNext three shots fire to the third bear : 1 1 1\n\nFinally the 7th shot will be fired and all the three \nbears will die at once.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1<=a,b,c<=10^8\n```\n",
