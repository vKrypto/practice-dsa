    "description": "You're invited to a delicious banquet with n delectable dishes represented by their bitwise representation (numbers between 1 and 10^9). However, some dishes are hidden under silver cloches (k operations allowed). You can lift a cloche and double the bitwise representation of one hidden dish under it. Your goal is to maximize the overall \"deliciousness\" of the feast, measured by the bitwise OR of all dish values after lifting cloches.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n### `Input:`\n\n- `n: Number of dishes (integers) - Integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).`<br>\n- `nums: Array of dish bitwise representations - Integers between 1 and 10^9 for each dish in the 0-based index of nums.`<br>\n- `k: Number of cloches you can lift - Integer between 1 and 15 (inclusive).`\n### `Output:`<br>\n\n`max_deliciousness: The maximum possible bitwise OR of all dish values after lifting cloches at most k times.`\n\n\n#### `Example 1:`\n\n#### `Input:`<br/>\n `n = 2, nums = [12, 9], k = 1`<br>\n#### `Output:` \n`30 (Explanation: Lift the cloche on dish 1 to get [12, 18].
