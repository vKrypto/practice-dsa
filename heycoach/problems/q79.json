    "description": "Given an input stream of A of n characters consisting only of lower case alphabets. The task is to find the **first non repeating** character, each time a character is inserted to the stream. If there is no such character then append '#' to the answer. After processing all n characters return the resultant string.\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nA = \"aabc\"\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n\"a#bb\"\n``` \n#### Explanation:\nFor every character first non-repeating character is as follow-\n\"a\" - first non-repeating character is 'a'\n\"aa\" - no non-repeating character so '#'\n\"aab\" - first non-repeating character is 'b'\n\"aabc\" - first non-repeating character is 'b'\n\n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nA = \"zz\"\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n\"z#\"\n``` \n#### Explanation:\nFor every character first non-repeating character is as follow-\n\"z\" - first non-repeating character is 'z'\n\"zz\" - no non-repeating character so '#'\n### Constraints:\n\n* 1 <= A.length <= 10000\n* string A contains lowercase English letters.\n",
