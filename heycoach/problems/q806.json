    "description": "Aiden is gearing up to tackle an IQ assessment. Among the array of challenges, one recurrent task demands discerning which of the provided n numerical values deviates from the norm. Aiden observed that typically, a single number distinguishes itself from the rest by its parity. To aid Aiden in verifying his responses, he seeks a program capable of pinpointing the odd one out among the given n numbers based on evenness.\n\n\n\n\n`Input  : ` \n\nThe first line contains an integer, n (3\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100), which represents the number of integers in the sequence. The second line consists of n space-separated natural numbers, each not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in terms of evenness\n\n\n`Output :`\n\nOutput index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.",
