    "description": "You are the captain of a ship and unfortunately, your crew has been sailing the sea for days now. You are running out of resources but luckily you see a land and decide to land there. When you meet the people of the land, you realize they speak very differently and you need a way to communicate with them.                               \n\nYou read the things on the island and realize that the people there also use the same English alphabet but in a different order. You ask for a book to understand the order but can only find a dictionary. There are 'n' words in the dictionary and 'k' number of alphabets.\n\nYou are given an array containing the words from those pages of the dictionary (just like a standard dictionary) and your task is to find the order of characters (like in English it's a,b,c,...z.)\n\n**`Sample Input:`**\n\n`n=2 , k=3`\n\n`baa, aac`\n\n**`Sample Output:`**\n\n`b,a,c`\n\n**` Explanation:`** `Since the first word that appears is 'baa' meaning b is the first character followed by a and then the second word indicates that the third letter is 'c'.`\n\n**`Constraints:`**\n\n- `1<=k<=26 `  \n- `1<=n<=100`\n- `1 \u2264 Length of words \u2264 50`\n",
