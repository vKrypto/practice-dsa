    "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an `equal` number of positive and negative integers.\nYou should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:\n\n1. Every `consecutive pair` of integers have `opposite` signs.\n2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.\n3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.\nReturn the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.\n\n### Example 1 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\nnums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\nThe positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].\nThe only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].\nOther ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions. \n\n\n\n\n### Example 2 \n\n### Input\n```CPP\n[-1,1]\n``` \n### Output \n```CPP \n[1,-1]\n``` \n#### Explanation:\n1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.\nSo nums is rearranged to [1,-1]. \n\n\n",
