    "description": "\nYou are given an integer total indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers cost1 and cost2 indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend `part or all` of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.\n\nReturn the `number of distinct ways` you can buy some number of pens and pencils.\n\n### Example 1\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\ntotal = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n9\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nThe price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.\n\n- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.\n- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.\n- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.\n  The total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.\n\n### Example 2\n\n### Input\n\n```CPP\ntotal = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```CPP\n1\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nThe price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- 1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 10^6\n",
