    "description": "*n* friends stand in a circle. For each friend his height a[i] is known. Two friends can be made to stand beside each other to minimize the height difference,  i.e. *|ai\u2009-\u2009aj|* is minimal. So each of them will be less noticeable with the other. Output the minimal difference possible between two friends.\n### Input\n```\nThe first line contains integer n (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 amount of friends. Then follow the heights of the friends in their order in the circle \u2014 n space-separated integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u20091000). The friend heights are given in clockwise direction.\n```\n\n### Output\n```\nOutput the minimal difference possible between two friends.\n```\n### Sample Input\n```\n5\n10 12 13 15 10\n```\n### Sample Output\n```\n0\n```\n### Explanation\n```\nThe input represents the heights of friends:\n10 12 13 15 10\nAfter sorting the array in ascending order, we get:\n10 10 12 13 15\nNow, we find the pair of neighboring friends with the minimum absolute height difference. In this case, the minimum difference is 0 which is between the two firends with same height 10 and 10.\n```",
