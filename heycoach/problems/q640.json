    "description": "Bholu and Dholu play a game. Initially each player receives one fixed positive integer that doesn't change throughout the game. Bholu receives number a and Dholu receives number b. They also have a heap of n stones. The players take turns to make a move and Bholu starts. During a move a player should take from the heap the number of stones equal to the greatest common divisor of the fixed number he has received and the number of stones left in the heap. A player loses when he cannot take the required number of stones (i. e. the heap has strictly less stones left than one needs to take).\n\nYour task is to determine who wins the game.\n\n**`Input`**  \n`The only string contains space-separated integers a, b and n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b,\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the fixed numbers Bholu and Dholu have received correspondingly and the initial number of stones in the pile.`\n\n**`Output`**    \n`If Bholu wins, print \"0\" (without the quotes), otherwise print \"1\" (without the quotes).`\n\n**`Sample Input`**  \n`3 5 9`  \n**`Sample Output`**  \n`0`  \n**`Explanation`**  \n`The greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers a and b is such maximum positive integer k, that a is divisible by k without remainder and similarly, b is divisible by k without remainder. Let gcd(a,\u2009b) represent the operation of calculating the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. Specifically, gcd(x,\u20090)\u2009=\u2009gcd(0,\u2009x)\u2009=\u2009x.`\n\n`In the first sample the game will go like that:`\n\n```\n\nSimon should take gcd(3,\u20099)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 6 stones left.\nAntisimon should take gcd(5,\u20096)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 5 stones left.\nSimon should take gcd(3,\u20095)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 4 stones left.\nAntisimon should take gcd(5,\u20094)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 3 stones left.\nSimon should take gcd(3,\u20093)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 0 stones left.\nAntisimon should take gcd(5,\u20090)\u2009=\u20095 stones from the heap. As 0\u2009<\u20095, it is impossible and Antisimon loses.\n```",
