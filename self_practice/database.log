/// master slave structure


1) one master for write, multiple slaves for read structure


Replication  Lag,
Map a users to same replica every time. ( based on User-hash)
Read Your Own Writes can help to avoid some usecases
Monotonic Reads

// replicas
1) Single Leader replicas
>>> auto Failover handling, if leader is down, assign leader to a follower 

2) multiple Leader replicas
>>>> need topology for communication between leaders
>>>> Incorrect Order Prefix Reads can accur.(change 1 propagate after change 2 for any leader)

3) leaderless replication
>>> example : casandra, dynamodb
>>> no leaders
>>> all nodes accepts reads and writes
>>> Better availability
>>> decentralized design
>>> typically use in write intensive apps, where availability more important than consistency.

>>>> we use concept of quorum consensus to get non-stale data.
>>>> write at least x nodes from n nodes. where x + r > N
>>>> read from all nodes and resolve confilt and then repair stale data:
>>>>>>>>>Read Repair  or Background syncing. process
>>>>> Exmaple: dynamodb


:::: Popular Data structure

1) SkipList
2) B- tree
3) Hash Index
4) ss Table
5) inverted Index
6) suffix tree
7) LSM tree
8) R tree



::: scaling database

1) sharding
2) splintering
3) horizontal partitioning.




::: LSM tree
Compaction ( merge sort ) required (can be heavy as database grows too much) 
Compressed better space used.
exmplae: LevelDB
not goood for lot of writes. (rate of writes < rate of Compaction)

::: B tree database ( page oriented database)
segmentations is there so more space used.
uses Write ahead log.(WAL) to recover from data loss/ failure
exmplae: My Sql, Innodb
goood for lot of writes.
