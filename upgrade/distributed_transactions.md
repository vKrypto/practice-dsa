# üîë Distributed Transactions: 2PC, 3PC, Saga

## 2PC (Two-Phase Commit)

-   **What it is:** Classic distributed transaction protocol.\
-   **How:**
    1.  **Prepare phase** -- coordinator asks participants if they can
        commit.\
    2.  **Commit phase** -- if all say "yes," coordinator tells them to
        commit; else rollback.\
-   **Guarantees:** Strong consistency (all-or-nothing).\
-   **Cons:** Blocking (if coordinator dies after prepare but before
    commit, participants are stuck).\
-   **Use case:** Banking (money transfer between accounts in different
    DBs), critical systems where atomicity is mandatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3PC (Three-Phase Commit)

-   **What it is:** Extension of 2PC with an extra **"pre-commit"
    phase** to reduce blocking.\
-   **How:**
    1.  **CanCommit** -- ask if participants *can* commit.\
    2.  **PreCommit** -- coordinator tells participants to prepare &
        acknowledge.\
    3.  **DoCommit** -- final commit.\
-   **Guarantees:** Non-blocking under some failure scenarios.\
-   **Cons:** More network overhead, still not 100% safe under partition
    (CAP says nope). Rarely used in real systems.\
-   **Use case:** Research/academic, or ultra-high reliability
    distributed databases (not common in practice).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saga

-   **What it is:** Long-lived distributed transaction broken into **a
    sequence of local transactions**, each with a **compensating
    action** if it fails.\
-   **Types:**
    -   **Choreography:** each service publishes events; other services
        listen & react.\
    -   **Orchestration:** central coordinator tells each service what
        to do.\
-   **Guarantees:** Eventual consistency (not atomic), but highly
    available & scalable.\
-   **Cons:** Complex compensation logic, debugging harder.\
-   **Use case:** Microservices (e-commerce order ‚Üí payment ‚Üí inventory
    ‚Üí shipping).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö°Ô∏è TL;DR

-   **2PC** ‚Üí Strong consistency, blocking, critical financial ops.\
-   **3PC** ‚Üí Adds safety vs.¬†coordinator failure, but rarely used.\
-   **Saga** ‚Üí Eventual consistency, best for microservices & long
    workflows.
