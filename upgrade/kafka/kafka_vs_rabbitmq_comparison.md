# ðŸ§± Kafka vs RabbitMQ Architecture & Use Case Comparison

## Basic Structural Layout

### ðŸ“¦ Kafka Architecture
```
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
|   Producer 1   |-----> |                |       |                |
|   Producer 2   |-----> |    Kafka       |-----> |    Consumers   |
|   Producer N   |-----> |  Cluster (Brokers)     | (via Consumer  |
|                |       |                |       |    Groups)     |
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+

Key Concepts:
- Topic (partitioned)
- Broker
- Zookeeper or KRaft
- Consumer Groups (load balancing)
```

### ðŸ“¬ RabbitMQ Architecture

+----------------+       +------------------+       +----------------+
|   Producer     |-----> |   Exchange        |-----> |     Queue      |
+----------------+       |  (direct/topic/   |       |    (bound to   |
                         |   fanout/headers) |       |    exchange)   |
                         +------------------+       +----------------+
                                                       |   |   |
                                                       v   v   v
                                                    Consumers

Key Concepts:
- Queue
- Exchange
- Routing Key
- Bindings
- Acknowledgment, DLQ, TTL
