| **Availability**                | High (masterless, no SPOF); can survive multiple node failures                                      | High via Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), but RW quorum must be maintained              |
| **Latency (Read)**              | Eventually consistent reads; can be stale if consistency level is low                               | Immediate consistent reads                                                                         |

| **Monitoring / Observability**  | Exposes metrics via JMX; must integrate with tools like Prometheus/Grafana                          | Full monitoring in SSMS; built-in query stats, waits, plans, SQL Agent                             |
| **Security**                    | Basic auth + SSL; Role-based access; lacks fine-grained row-level security                          | Fine-grained access (schemas, roles, row-level, encryption at rest & transit, auditing)           |
| **Maturity & Ecosystem**        | Strong open-source ecosystem (DataStax, Astra, ScyllaDB)                                             | Mature Microsoft ecosystem, backed by strong enterprise support                                    |
| **Cost (Self-hosted)**          | Free (Apache); infra cost high due to many nodes                                                     | License fee unless using Express / Developer edition                                               |

|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clustered Deployment Support** | Both support multi-node clusters, HA, replication, and failover (but very differently)     |
| **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**    | Both write to WAL first before flushing to disk (Cassandra: Commit Log; SQL Server: Log)   |
| **Snapshots**                    | Both support snapshot-based backups                                                        |
| **Monitoring**                   | Both expose metrics for monitoring (Cassandra via JMX, SQL Server via DMVs/SSMS)           |
| **Multi-Node Write Support**     | Both can write on multiple nodes but Cassandra is masterless, SQL Server needs coordination|
| **Indexing Exists**              | Both support indexing (but SQL has richer, deeper support)                                 |

## ‚ùå Limitations

### Cassandra

- No JOINs, GROUP BY, or subqueries
- Cannot support strict transactional logic across partitions
- Storage bloat due to compaction and tombstones
- Limited secondary indexing
- Harder to model normalized data
- Lacks mature native PITR
- Not suited for real-time analytics

### SQL Server

- Poor horizontal scalability (write bottlenecks in clustered environments)
- Expensive licensing (esp. Enterprise Edition)
- Complex HA setup and failover management
- Less resilient in multi-region active-active scenarios
- Slower writes compared to Cassandra under high load

## üß† Final Thoughts

- **Cassandra** is like a tank for *massive distributed ingestion*, but hates joins and analytics. Treat it like a write-optimized log store with predictable access patterns.
- **SQL Server** is a relational beast with deep ACID guarantees, but scaling it out is an architectural event.
- If you **need strong schema, cross-entity integrity, and rich queries**, go **SQL Server**.
- If you **need infinite scale, global availability, and write performance**, **Cassandra** wins.
- Combining both? Use **Cassandra** as a **hot, fast-write layer** and **SQL Server** as **cold, consistent analytical core**.
