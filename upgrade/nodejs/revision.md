# ðŸ§  Quick One-Liners: Webpack, Vite, and Ecosystem Tools

- **Webpack**: Highly-configurable bundler best suited for large-scale and complex frontend apps.
- **Loaders**: Transform non-JS files (like CSS, SCSS, images) into valid JS modules in Webpack.
- **Plugins**: Extend or hook into Webpackâ€™s build lifecycle for custom behaviors like HTML injection or minification.
- **Tree Shaking**: Eliminates dead code from final Webpack builds to optimize bundle size.
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Replaces modules in the browser without a full reload during development.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast frontend tooling using native ESM and Rollup for optimized builds.
- **Vite SSR**: Supports server-side rendering with separate client/server builds using custom middleware.
- **Vite vs Webpack**: Vite is ideal for small/medium apps, Webpack dominates in enterprise-level builds.
- **Jest**: All-in-one JavaScript testing framework for unit, integration, and snapshot testing.
- **Mocha + Chai**: Modular testing stack where Mocha is the runner and Chai provides expressive assertions.
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript preprocessor for Jest allowing seamless TS test integration.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis tool for enforcing JS/TS code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter for automatic, opinionated styling across your codebase.
- **Husky**: Git hook tool to run checks (like lint/test) before commits or pushes.
- **npm/Yarn/pnpm/Bun**: Package managers with different performance and dependency resolution strategies.
- **Bun**: A fast modern JS runtime with built-in bundler, test runner, and Node compatibility.
- **Svelte**: A compile-time JS framework that outputs minimal, highly-performant JS without a virtual DOM.
