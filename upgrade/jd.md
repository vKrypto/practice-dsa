# Staff Software Engineer (Backend / Distributed Systems)

## About the Role
We are seeking a **Staff Software Engineer** with 7+ years of experience in designing and scaling complex distributed systems. This role requires deep technical expertise, hands-on coding skills, and the ability to drive architectural decisions that impact products at scale. Youâ€™ll collaborate with cross-functional teams, mentor senior engineers, and shape the technical roadmap for high-performance, fault-tolerant systems.  

## Key Responsibilities
- **Architecture & System Design**: Lead end-to-end design of scalable, reliable, and high-availability systems (APIs, microservices, event-driven systems).  
- **Hands-On Development**: Write clean, performant code using **Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js/Express, React, .NET** (growing proficiency).  
- **Database Expertise**: Optimize and scale SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis, Kafka Streams) solutions.  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Architect and deploy solutions on **AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform**, with strong focus on cost-efficiency, observability, and automation.  
- **Performance & Reliability**: Solve critical bottlenecks, improve latency, throughput, and resilience across distributed services.

- Expertise in **Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js/Express, React**, with working knowledge of **.NET**.  
- Deep experience with **databases, caching, indexing, replication, and high-performance query optimization**.  
- Cloud-native architecture design with **AWS (ECS/EKS, RDS, S3, CloudFront)** and infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines).  
- Strong understanding of **concurrency, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams), event-driven design, and CAP trade-offs**.  
- Proven ability to lead cross-team initiatives and **mentor engineers at scale**.  

## Why Join Us?
- Opportunity to **drive architectural vision** for large-scale systems.  
- Work with **cutting-edge technologies** across backend, cloud, and infrastructure.  
- Be part of a **high-impact engineering culture** where your decisions shape products and teams.
