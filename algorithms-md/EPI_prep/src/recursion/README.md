# Recursion

Recursion is an approach to problem solving where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems.

A recursive function consists of base cases and calls to the same function with different arguments. 
Two key ingredients to a successful use of recursion are identifying the base cases, which are to be solved directly, 
and ensuring progress, that is the recursion converges to the solution.


## Questions

In this section we will solve common recursion questions that will help you understand these alogrithms. This will in turn give you the ability to solve other binary questions
