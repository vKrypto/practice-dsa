# K Pairs with Largest Sums (Hard) ✩

Given two sorted arrays in descending order, 
find ‘K’ pairs with the largest sum where each pair consists of numbers from both the arrays.

### Example 1
Input: L1=[9, 8, 2], L2=[6, 3, 1], K=3
Output: [9, 3], [9, 6], [8, 6] 
Explanation: These 3 pairs have the largest sum. No other pair has a sum larger than any of these.


### Example 2
Input: L1=[5, 2, 1], L2=[2, -1], K=3
Output: [5, 2], [5, -1], [2, 2]
