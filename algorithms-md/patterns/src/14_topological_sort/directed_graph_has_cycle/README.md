# Directed Graph Has Cycle (medium) âœ©

Find if a given Directed Graph has a cycle in it or not.

### Example 1
Input: Vertices=4, Edges=[3, 2], [3, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 3]
Output: True
Explanation: 3 is leads 2 and also lead to 3. This creates a cycle 


### Example 2
Input: Vertices=5, Edges=[4, 2], [4, 3], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1], [0, 2]
Output: True

### Example 3
Input: Vertices=7, Edges=[6, 4], [6, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1]
Output: False
