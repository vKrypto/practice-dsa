# Search in Rotated Array With Duplicates (medium) ✩

Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and 
also rotated by some arbitrary number, find if a given ‘key’ is present in it.

Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ in the rotated array. 
If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1. You can assume that the given array can have duplicates.

### Example 1
Input: [3, 7, 3, 3, 3], key = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: '7' is present in the array at index '1'.
