# Happy Number (medium) ✩

Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with 
a number equal to the sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to number ‘1’. 
All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach ‘1’. 
Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers which does not include ‘1’.
