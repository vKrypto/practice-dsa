# Tree Diameter (medium)âœ©

Given a binary tree, find the length of its diameter. 
The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest 
path between any two leaf nodes. 

The diameter of a tree may or may not pass through the root.

Note: You can always assume that there are at least two leaf nodes in the given tree.
