# Time complexity O(N*2^N)
# Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles 
# as we add each element to all the existing subsets, 
# therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, 
# where â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of elements in the input set. 
# And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, 
# therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N)

# Space complexity O(N*2^N)
# All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. 
# Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to 
# O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N).
