# Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a sequence, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS). 
In a palindromic subsequence, elements read the same backward and forward.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example 1:
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 5
Explanation: LPS is "abdba".

### Example 2:
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 3
Explanation: LPS is "ddd".

### Example 3:
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 1
Explanation: LPS could be "p", "q" or "r".
