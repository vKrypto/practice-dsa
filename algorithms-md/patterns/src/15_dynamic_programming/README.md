## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem 
by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution 
to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.

This section categorizes dynamic coding interview problems into a set of 5 patterns. 
Under each pattern there will be a specific category of problems to solve. 
The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.
