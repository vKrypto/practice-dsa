# House Theif

There are n houses built in a line. A thief wants to steal the maximum possible money from these houses. 
The only restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive houses, 
as that would alert the security system. How should the thief maximize his stealing?

## Problem Statement
Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum 
amount of money the thief can steal without alerting the security system

### Example 1:
Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
Output: 15
Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 5 + 6 + 4

### Example 2:
Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
Output: 18
Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 10 + 8
